                                The world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is rapidly evolving, and with it 
                                comes the need for powerful and intuitive tools to help investors and
                                collectors navigate this complex market. Easyzoom is a revolutionary NFT 
                                analysis tool that provides advanced analytics and visualization
                                capabilities, allowing users to easily understand and interpret the data.

                                analytics that provide a deep dive into sales history, floor prices, volumes, 
                                and trends. With the exclusive whale tracking features, you can discover the 
                                NFTs biggest players and see which NFTs they are buying and selling. With 
                                the live feed data, you can stay on top of the NFT market keeping track of 
                                every sale, transfer, and mint, and get instant alerts when important events 
                                occur. With the wallet history feature, you can easily sift through each wallet 
                                to see which NFTs are being bought and sold, and watch as the profits 
                                (loss) roll in.

                            Staking is a key aspect of the Easyzoom DAO, as it allows members of the 
                            community to earn rewards for their participation in the project.
                            By staking their passes, members are committing to the success of the 
                            project and will be incentivized to actively participate and contribute to its 
                            growth.

                            To implement this system, Easyzoom will make use of a staking system that 
                            will be based on a quarterly or biannual basis. This will allow for regular 
                            rewards those will be distributed based on the number of passes held and 
                            staked by members, providing an incentive to actively participate in the 
                            growth of the project and hold onto their passes.

                            The profits generated by the DAO will come from a variety of sources which

                            anyone. It will be transparently communicated and updated through our 
                            communication channels (Website, Twitter, Discord), so that DAO members 
                            can stay informed and up to date on the status of their staked passes and
